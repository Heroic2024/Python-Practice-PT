# Python Practice Repository

A collection of Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental Python programming concepts and data structures.

## 📚 Notebooks Overview

### 1. **python_basics.ipynb**
Foundational Python concepts including:
- Numeric operations and memory addresses (`id()` function)
- Arithmetic operations (addition, division, floor division)
- Digit manipulation (extracting and swapping digits)
- Variable swapping techniques
- Basic variable assignments and type operations

**Key Topics:** Variables, numeric types, operators, memory management

---

### 2. **conditional_statements_patterns.ipynb**
Control flow and decision-making structures:
- `if` statements
- `if-else` conditional blocks
- `if-elif-else` ladder patterns
- Nested conditional statements
- Boolean logic and comparison operators
- Real-world conditional examples (age verification, etc.)

**Key Topics:** Conditionals, boolean logic, control flow

---

### 3. **strings.ipynb**
String data type operations:
- String immutability concepts
- Indexing and slicing strings
- String concatenation
- Memory allocation for strings
- String methods and operations
- String formatting and manipulation

**Key Topics:** String basics, indexing, slicing, immutability

---

### 4. **list-tuples-strings.ipynb**
Comprehensive guide to sequence data structures:
- List creation, indexing, and manipulation
- Tuple creation and properties
- String operations (combined coverage)
- List methods (append, extend, insert, remove, etc.)
- Tuple unpacking
- Iterating through sequences
- Combining multiple data structure types

**Key Topics:** Lists, tuples, sequences, iteration

---

### 5. **tuples_sets_dictionary.ipynb**
Advanced collection data structures:
- **Tuples:** Immutable sequences, unpacking, tuple operations
- **Sets:** Unique elements, set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs, accessing, modifying, dictionary methods
- Set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions
- Nested data structures
- Real-world examples with complex data

**Key Topics:** Tuples, sets, dictionaries, data structure operations
